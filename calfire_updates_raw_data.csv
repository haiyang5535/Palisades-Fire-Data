  Before law enforcement officials can re-open evacuation zones, it’s crucial to ensure that hazards are mitigated in the fire area. Even in evacuation zones where homes may not have been damaged, many cooperators are working to mitigate hazards like fallen power lines, burned out guard rails, and clearing significant wind damaged trees and other debris. Wait for official clearance before heading back and follow officials’ safety precautions once allowed in.
Residents seeking re-entry will be required to provide proof of residency when approaching roadblocks. Acceptable forms of identification include a government-issued photo ID that clearly displays the resident's name, photo, and physical address. These measures are in place to facilitate a safe and organized re-entry process.

Even in evacuation zones where homes may not have been damaged, many cooperators are working to mitigate hazards like fallen power lines, burned out guard rails, and clearing significant wind damaged trees and other debris. Wait for official clearance before heading back and follow officials’ safety precautions once allowed in.
Residents seeking re-entry will be required to provide proof of residency when approaching roadblocks. Acceptable forms of identification include a government-issued photo ID that clearly displays the resident's name, photo, and physical address.

Before law enforcement officials can re-open evacuation zones, it’s crucial to ensure that hazards are mitigated in the fire area. Even in evacuation zones where homes may not have been damaged, many cooperators are working to mitigate hazards like fallen power lines, burned out guard rails, and clearing significant wind damaged trees and other debris. Wait for official clearance before heading back and follow officials’ safety precautions once allowed in.
Residents seeking re-entry will be required to provide proof of residency when approaching roadblocks. Acceptable forms of identification include a government-issued photo ID that clearly displays the resident's name, photo, and physical address. These measures are in place to facilitate a safe and organized re-entry process.

Before law enforcement officials can re-open evacuation zones, it’s crucial to ensure that hazards are mitigated in the fire area. Even in evacuation zones where homes may not have been damaged, many cooperators are working to mitigate hazards like fallen power lines, burned out guard rails, and clearing significant wind damaged trees and other debris. Wait for official clearance before heading back and follow officials’ safety precautions once allowed in.
Residents seeking re-entry will be required to provide proof of residency when approaching roadblocks. Acceptable forms of identification include a government-issued photo ID that clearly displays the resident's name, photo, and physical address. These measures are in place to facilitate a safe and organized re-entry process.

Before law enforcement officials can re-open evacuation zones, it’s crucial to ensure that hazards are mitigated in the fire area. Even in evacuation zones where homes may not have been damaged, many cooperators are working to mitigate hazards like fallen power lines, burned out guard rails, and clearing significant wind damaged trees and other debris. Wait for official clearance before heading back and follow officials’ safety precautions once allowed in.
Residents seeking re-entry will be required to provide proof of residency when approaching roadblocks. Acceptable forms of identification include a government-issued photo ID that clearly displays the resident's name, photo, and physical address. These measures are in place to facilitate a safe and organized re-entry process.

Before law enforcement officials can re-open evacuation zones, it’s crucial to ensure that hazards are mitigated in the fire area. Even in evacuation zones where homes may not have been damaged, many cooperators are working to mitigate hazards like fallen power lines, burned out guard rails, and clearing significant wind damaged trees and other debris. Wait for official clearance before heading back and follow officials’ safety precautions once allowed in.
Residents seeking re-entry will be required to provide proof of residency when approaching roadblocks. Acceptable forms of identification include a government-issued photo ID that clearly displays the resident's name, photo, and physical address. These measures are in place to facilitate a safe and organized re-entry process.

Before law enforcement officials can re-open evacuation zones, it’s crucial to ensure that hazards are mitigated in the fire area. Even in evacuation zones where homes may not have been damaged, many cooperators are working to mitigate hazards like fallen power lines, burned out guard rails, and clearing significant wind damaged trees and other debris. Wait for official clearance before heading back and follow officials’ safety precautions once allowed in.
Residents seeking re-entry will be required to provide proof of residency when approaching roadblocks. Acceptable forms of identification include a government-issued photo ID that clearly displays the resident's name, photo, and physical address. These measures are in place to facilitate a safe and organized re-entry process.

Before law enforcement officials can re-open evacuation zones, it’s crucial to ensure that hazards are mitigated in the fire area. Even in evacuation zones where homes may not have been damaged, many cooperators are working to mitigate hazards like fallen power lines, burned out guard rails, and clearing significant wind damaged trees and other debris. Wait for official clearance before heading back and follow officials’ safety precautions once allowed in.
Residents seeking re-entry will be required to provide proof of residency when approaching roadblocks. Acceptable forms of identification include a government-issued photo ID that clearly displays the resident's name, photo, and physical address. These measures are in place to facilitate a safe and organized re-entry process.

Before law enforcement officials can re-open evacuation zones, it’s crucial to ensure that hazards are mitigated in the fire area. Even in evacuation zones where homes may not have been damaged, many cooperators are working to mitigate hazards like fallen power lines, burned out guard rails, and clearing significant wind damaged trees and other debris. Wait for official clearance before heading back and follow officials’ safety precautions once allowed in.
Residents seeking re-entry will be required to provide proof of residency when approaching roadblocks. Acceptable forms of identification include a government-issued photo ID that clearly displays the resident's name, photo, and physical address. These measures are in place to facilitate a safe and organized re-entry process.

Before law enforcement officials can re-open evacuation zones, it’s crucial to ensure that hazards are mitigated in the fire area. Even in evacuation zones where homes may not have been damaged, many cooperators are working to mitigate hazards like fallen power lines, burned out guard rails, and clearing significant wind damaged trees and other debris. Wait for official clearance before heading back and follow officials’ safety precautions once allowed in.
Residents seeking re-entry will be required to provide proof of residency when approaching roadblocks. Acceptable forms of identification include a government-issued photo ID that clearly displays the resident's name, photo, and physical address. These measures are in place to facilitate a safe and organized re-entry process.

Before law enforcement officials can re-open evacuation zones, it’s crucial to ensure that hazards are mitigated in the fire area. Even in evacuation zones where homes may not have been damaged, many cooperators are working to mitigate hazards like fallen power lines, burned out guard rails, and clearing significant wind damaged trees and other debris. Wait for official clearance before heading back and follow officials’ safety precautions once allowed in.
Residents seeking re-entry will be required to provide proof of residency when approaching roadblocks. Acceptable forms of identification include a government-issued photo ID that clearly displays the resident's name, photo, and physical address. These measures are in place to facilitate a safe and organized re-entry process.

Before law enforcement officials can re-open evacuation zones, it’s crucial to ensure that hazards are mitigated in the fire area. Even in evacuation zones where homes may not have been damaged, many cooperators are working to mitigate hazards like fallen power lines, burned out guard rails, and clearing significant wind damaged trees and other debris. Wait for official clearance before heading back and follow officials’ safety precautions once allowed in.
Residents seeking re-entry will be required to provide proof of residency when approaching roadblocks. Acceptable forms of identification include a government-issued photo ID that clearly displays the resident's name, photo, and physical address. These measures are in place to facilitate a safe and organized re-entry process.

Even in evacuation zones where homes may not have been damaged, many cooperators are working to mitigate hazards like fallen power lines, burned out guard rails, and clearing significant wind damaged trees and other debris. Wait for official clearance before heading back and follow officials’ safety precautions once allowed in.
Residents seeking re-entry will be required to provide proof of residency when approaching roadblocks. Acceptable forms of identification include a government-issued photo ID that clearly displays the resident's name, photo, and physical address.

Before law enforcement officials can re-open evacuation zones, it’s crucial to ensure that hazards are mitigated in the fire area. Even in evacuation zones where homes may not have been damaged, many cooperators are working to mitigate hazards like fallen power lines, burned out guard rails, and clearing significant wind damaged trees and other debris. Wait for official clearance before heading back and follow officials’ safety precautions once allowed in.
Residents seeking re-entry will be required to provide proof of residency when approaching roadblocks. Acceptable forms of identification include a government-issued photo ID that clearly displays the resident's name, photo, and physical address.

Wait for official clearance before heading back and follow officials’ safety precautions once allowed in.

Acceptable forms of identification include a government-issued photo ID that clearly displays the resident's name, photo, and physical address.

Before law enforcement officials can re-open evacuation zones, it’s crucial to ensure that hazards are mitigated in the fire area. Even in evacuation zones where homes may not have been damaged, many cooperators are working to mitigate hazards like fallen power lines, burned out guard rails, and clearing significant wind damaged trees and other debris. Wait for official clearance before heading back and follow officials’ safety precautions once allowed in.
Residents seeking re-entry will be required to provide proof of residency when approaching roadblocks. Acceptable forms of identification include a government-issued photo ID that clearly displays the resident's name, photo, and physical address. These measures are in place to facilitate a safe and organized re-entry process.

Before law enforcement officials can re-open evacuation zones, it’s crucial to ensure that hazards are mitigated in the fire area. Even in evacuation zones where homes may not have been damaged, many cooperators are working to mitigate hazards like fallen power lines, burned out guard rails, and clearing significant wind damaged trees and other debris. Wait for official clearance before heading back and follow officials’ safety precautions once allowed in.
Residents seeking re-entry will be required to provide proof of residency when approaching roadblocks. Acceptable forms of identification include a government-issued photo ID that clearly displays the resident's name, photo, and physical address. These measures are in place to facilitate a safe and organized re-entry process.

Current Situation
Situation Summary
Weather conditions return to seasonally normal, and fire is expected to remain within the current perimeter with no additional growth anticipated. With the returning Santa Ana winds Monday, widespread critical fire weather conditions remain present. Crews continue to establish and improve the fire line, seek out and extinguish hot spots and construct containment lines to limit further structural damage within the areas still at risk. Supporting search and rescue efforts where needed. 
There is an increased need for specialized supplies related to all-hazards response for responders and repopulating civilians, including masks, respirators, gloves, eye protection and decontamination, is present. 
Please be advised: An inaccurate social media post is currently circulating on Facebook. The post claims that individuals can come to California to join a clean-up crew in areas affected by recent LA wildfires. This information is false, and we would like to clarify that there is no such opportunity available. We kindly ask that you refrain from calling to inquire about this.

Current Situation
Situation Summary
Weather conditions return to seasonally normal, and fire is expected to remain within the current perimeter with no additional growth anticipated. With the returning Santa Ana winds Monday, widespread critical fire weather conditions remain present. Crews continue to establish and improve the fire line, seek out and extinguish hot spots and construct containment lines to limit further structural damage within the areas still at risk. Supporting search and rescue efforts where needed. 
There is an increased need for specialized supplies related to all-hazards response for responders and repopulating civilians, including masks, respirators, gloves, eye protection and decontamination, is present. 
Please be advised: An inaccurate social media post is currently circulating on Facebook. The post claims that individuals can come to California to join a clean-up crew in areas affected by recent LA wildfires. This information is false, and we would like to clarify that there is no such opportunity available. We kindly ask that you refrain from calling to inquire about this.

Situation Summary
Weather conditions return to seasonally normal, and fire is expected to remain within the current perimeter with no additional growth anticipated. With the returning Santa Ana winds Monday, widespread critical fire weather conditions remain present. Crews continue to establish and improve the fire line, seek out and extinguish hot spots and construct containment lines to limit further structural damage within the areas still at risk. Supporting search and rescue efforts where needed. 
There is an increased need for specialized supplies related to all-hazards response for responders and repopulating civilians, including masks, respirators, gloves, eye protection and decontamination, is present. 
Please be advised: An inaccurate social media post is currently circulating on Facebook. The post claims that individuals can come to California to join a clean-up crew in areas affected by recent LA wildfires. This information is false, and we would like to clarify that there is no such opportunity available. We kindly ask that you refrain from calling to inquire about this.

Current Situation
Situation Summary
Weather conditions return to seasonally normal, and fire is expected to remain within the current perimeter with no additional growth anticipated. With the returning Santa Ana winds Monday, widespread critical fire weather conditions remain present. Crews continue to establish and improve the fire line, seek out and extinguish hot spots and construct containment lines to limit further structural damage within the areas still at risk. Supporting search and rescue efforts where needed. 
The ongoing search and recovery mission continues to limit utility agencies' ability to repair infrastructure, delaying the repopulation process, and an increased need for specialized supplies related to all-hazards response for responders and repopulating civilians, including masks, respirators, gloves, eye protection and decontamination, is present. 
Please be advised: An inaccurate social media post is currently circulating on Facebook. The post claims that individuals can come to California to join a clean-up crew in areas affected by recent LA wildfires. This information is false, and we would like to clarify that there is no such opportunity available. We kindly ask that you refrain from calling to inquire about this.

Current Situation
Situation Summary
Weather conditions return to seasonally normal, and fire is expected to remain within the current perimeter with no additional growth anticipated. With the returning Santa Ana winds Monday, widespread critical fire weather conditions remain present. Crews continue to establish and improve the fire line, seek out and extinguish hot spots and construct containment lines to limit further structural damage within the areas still at risk. Supporting search and rescue efforts where needed. 
The ongoing search and recovery mission continues to limit utility agencies' ability to repair infrastructure, delaying the repopulation process and an increased need for specialized supplies related to all-hazards response for responders and repopulating civilians, including masks, respirators, gloves, eye protection and decontamination, is present. 
Please be advised: An inaccurate social media post is currently circulating on Facebook. The post claims that individuals can come to California to join a clean-up crew in areas affected by recent LA wildfires. This information is false, and we would like to clarify that there is no such opportunity available. We kindly ask that you refrain from calling to inquire about this.

Situation Summary
Fire behavior was moderate today but potential for significant fire growth still exists. Firefighters continue to aggressively engage in fire suppression while providing for operational and personnel safety. Additionally, there are over 2,000 CAL Guard members involved in the firefight. 
Today, winds gusting 30-40MPH were observed, and humidity dropped to the 12-20% range. The RED FLAG WARNING will remain in effect through 6:00PM, Wednesday.
Please be advised: An inaccurate social media post is currently circulating on Facebook. The post claims that individuals can come to California to join a clean-up crew in areas affected by recent LA wildfires. This information is false, and we would like to clarify that there is no such opportunity available. We kindly ask that you refrain from calling to inquire about this.

Situation Summary
Overnight and this morning, low humidity and strong, gusty Santa Ana winds were observed with peak speeds around 50MPH. The RED FLAG WARNING will remain in effect and widespread critical fire weather is expected through Wednesday evening.Surge resources are prepositioned in and around the areas of Encino and Malibu in anticipation of the wind event.
Infrared flights are being conducted multiple times each day to identify heat pockets within the fire’s perimeter. Crews have been assigned to monitor these hotspots continuously and address them as part of mop-up operations.
Please be advised: An inaccurate social media post is currently circulating on Facebook. The post claims that individuals can come to California to join a clean-up crew in areas affected by recent LA wildfires. This information is false, and we would like to clarify that there is no such opportunity available. We kindly ask that you refrain from calling to inquire about this.

Situation Summary
Overnight and this morning, low humidity and strong, gusty Santa Ana winds were observed with peak speeds around 50MPH. The RED FLAG WARNING will remain in effect and widespread critical fire weather is expected through Wednesday evening.Surge resources are prepositioned in and around the areas of Encino and Malibu in anticipation of the wind event.
Infrared flights are being conducted multiple times each day to identify heat pockets within the fire’s perimeter. Crews have been assigned to monitor these hotspots continuously and address them as part of mop-up operations. 
Please be advised: An inaccurate social media post is currently circulating on Facebook. The post claims that individuals can come to California to join a clean-up crew in areas affected by recent LA wildfires. This information is false, and we would like to clarify that there is no such opportunity available. We kindly ask that you refrain from calling to inquire about this.

Situation Summary
For today through Wednesday, an extended period of moderate to strong Santa Ana winds will persist across the area, with the strongest winds to likely occur on Tuesday morning. Very dry conditions will remain across the area as the offshore wind continues so a RED FLAG WARNING will stay in effect till 6:00PM Wednesday evening. By Friday, offshore winds will end bringing cooler temperatures and higher humidity levels. Firefighters are continuing to work around the clock, minimizing acreage burned on all lands by utilizing effective strategies and tactics. 
Please be advised: An inaccurate social media post is currently circulating on Facebook. The post claims that individuals can come to California to join a clean-up crew in areas affected by recent LA wildfires. This information is false, and we would like to clarify that there is no such opportunity available. We kindly ask that you refrain from calling to inquire about this.

Situation Summary
For today through Wednesday, an extended period of moderate to strong Santa Ana winds will persist across the area, with the strongest winds to likely occur on Tuesday morning. Very dry conditions will remain across the area as the offshore wind continues so a RED FLAG WARNING will stay in effect till 6:00PM Wednesday evening. By Friday, offshore winds will end bringing cooler temperatures and higher humidity levels. Firefighters are continuing to work around the clock, minimizing acreage burned on all lands by utilizing effective strategies and tactics. 
Please be advised: An inaccurate social media post is currently circulating on Facebook. The post claims that individuals can come to California to join a clean-up crew in areas affected by recent LA wildfires. This information is false, and we would like to clarify that there is no such opportunity available. We kindly ask that you refrain from calling to inquire about this.

Situation Summary
For today through Wednesday, an extended period of moderate to strong Santa Ana winds will persist across the area, with the strongest winds to likely occur on Tuesday morning. Very dry conditions will remain across the area as the offshore wind continues so a RED FLAG WARNING will stay in effect till 6:00PM Wednesday evening. By Friday, offshore winds will end bringing cooler temperatures and higher humidity levels. Firefighters are continuing to work around the clock, minimizing acreage burned on all lands by utilizing effective strategies and tactics. 
Please be advised: An inaccurate social media post is currently circulating on Facebook. The post claims that individuals can come to California to join a clean-up crew in areas affected by recent LA wildfires. This information is false, and we would like to clarify that there is no such opportunity available. We kindly ask that you refrain from calling to inquire about this.

The post claims that individuals can come to California to join a clean-up crew in areas affected by recent LA wildfires. This information is false, and we would like to clarify that there is no such opportunity available. We kindly ask that you refrain from calling to inquire about this.

Situation Summary
Fire behavior was moderate today but there is still active fire within the fire perimeter. Unburned islands are still present and can pose a threat to containment lines, however firefighters have been working around the clock with a continued focus on fire suppression, human safety and private and public property assessment and protection. 
For tonight, gusty Santa Ana winds will continue with low humidity with the strongest winds occurring Tuesday morning. A RED FLAG WARNING is in effect and will remain in effect till 6:00PM Wednesday. 
Please be advised: An inaccurate social media post is currently circulating on Facebook. The post claims that individuals can come to California to join a clean-up crew in areas affected by recent LA wildfires. This information is false, and we would like to clarify that there is no such opportunity available. We kindly ask that you refrain from calling to inquire about this.

Situation Summary
Firefighting efforts continue to concentrate on building and improving containment lines with a focus on public safety and structure protection. For today, north to northeast winds will gradually increase, peaking in strength this evening and overnight. A FIRE WEATHER WATCH will begin at 6:00PM tonight and will remain in effect through 6:00PM Sunday night. Moderate to strong Santa Ana winds are likely to return Tuesday and Wednesday, creating critical fire weather conditions. 
The Los Angeles County and CAL FIRE Damage Assessment Teams (DINS) will continue to assess and validate structures impacted by the Palisades Fire. It is expected that more than 5,000 structures have been destroyed.
Please be advised: An inaccurate social media post is currently circulating on Facebook.

This information is false, and we would like to clarify that there is no such opportunity available. We kindly ask that you refrain from calling to inquire about this.

Moderate to strong Santa Ana winds are likely to return Tuesday and Wednesday, creating critical fire weather conditions.

Situation Summary
Firefighting efforts continue to concentrate on building and improving containment lines with a focus on public safety and structure protection. For today, north to northeast winds will gradually increase, peaking in strength this evening and overnight. A FIRE WEATHER WATCH will begin at 6:00PM tonight and will remain in effect through 6:00PM Sunday night. Moderate to strong Santa Ana winds are likely to return Tuesday and Wednesday, creating critical fire weather conditions. 
The Los Angeles County and CAL FIRE Damage Assessment Teams (DINS) will continue to assess and validate structures impacted by the Palisades Fire. It is expected that more than 5,000 structures have been destroyed.
The Los Angeles Unified School District has canceled classes for all schools Friday. Residents are encouraged to avoid nonessential travel to allow firefighters plenty of room to work.
Please be advised: An inaccurate social media post is currently circulating on Facebook. The post claims that individuals can come to California to join a clean-up crew in areas affected by recent LA wildfires. This information is false, and we would like to clarify that there is no such opportunity available. We kindly ask that you refrain from calling to inquire about this.

Situation Summary
Firefighting efforts continue to concentrate on building and improving containment lines with a focus on public safety and structure protection. For today, north to northeast winds will gradually increase, peaking in strength this evening and overnight. A FIRE WEATHER WATCH will begin at 6:00PM tonight and will remain in effect through 6:00PM Sunday night. Moderate to strong Santa Ana winds are likely to return Tuesday and Wednesday, creating critical fire weather conditions. 
The Los Angeles County and CAL FIRE Damage Assessment Teams (DINS) will continue to assess and validate structures impacted by the Palisades Fire. It is expected that more than 5,000 structures have been destroyed.
The Los Angeles Unified School District has canceled classes for all schools Friday. Residents are encouraged to avoid nonessential travel to allow firefighters plenty of room to work.
Additionally, we have been made aware that there is an inaccurate social media post circulating on Facebook suggesting that people can come work in California as part of a clean-up crew in areas that burned in recent wildfires. There is no truth to this social media post, and there is no need to call and inquire.

Situation Summary
Fire continues to burn actively with greatest rates of spread experienced on exposed ridgetops and drainages. Sunny skies prevailed across the incident today. Tonight, weak northerly winds are expected with low humidity. With this, critical fire weather conditions are possible Saturday night with a FIRE WEATHER WATCH expected to begin at 6PM. 
The Los Angeles County and CAL FIRE Damage Assessment Teams (DINS) will continue to assess and validate structures impacted by the Palisades Fire. It is expected that more than 5,000 structures have been destroyed.
The Los Angeles Unified School District has canceled classes for all schools Friday. Residents are encouraged to avoid nonessential travel to allow firefighters plenty of room to work.
Additionally, we have been made aware that there is an inaccurate social media post circulating on Facebook suggesting that people can come work in California as part of a clean-up crew in areas that burned in recent wildfires. There is no truth to this social media post, and there is no need to call and inquire.

Situation Summary
Fire continues to burn actively with greatest rates of spread experienced on exposed ridgetops and drainages. Sunny skies prevailed across the incident today. Tonight, weak northerly winds are expected with low humidity. With this, critical fire weather conditions are possible Saturday night with a FIRE WEATHER WATCH expected to begin at 6PM. 
The Los Angeles County and CAL FIRE Damage Assessment Teams (DINS) will continue to assess and validate structures impacted by the Palisades Fire. It is expected that more than 5,000 structures have been destroyed.
The Los Angeles Unified School District has canceled classes for all schools Friday. Residents are encouraged to avoid nonessential travel to allow firefighters plenty of room to work.
Additionally, we have been made aware that there is an inaccurate social media post circulating on Facebook suggesting that people can come work in California as part of a clean-up crew in areas that burned in recent wildfires. There is no truth to this social media post, and there is no need to call and inquire.

Situation Summary
Fire continues to burn actively with greatest rates of spread experienced on exposed ridgetops and drainages. Sunny skies prevailed across the incident today. Tonight, weak northerly winds are expected with low humidity. With this, critical fire weather conditions are possible Saturday night with a FIRE WEATHER WATCH expected to begin at 6PM. 
The Los Angeles County and CAL FIRE Damage Assessment Teams (DINS) will continue to assess and validate structures impacted by the Palisades Fire. It is expected that more than 5,000 structures have been destroyed.
The Los Angeles Unified School District has canceled classes for all schools Friday. Residents are encouraged to avoid nonessential travel to allow firefighters plenty of room to work.
Additionally, we have been made aware that there is an inaccurate social media post circulating on Facebook suggesting that people can come work in California as part of a clean-up crew in areas that burned in recent wildfires. There is no truth to this social media post, and there is no need to call and inquire.

Situation Summary
Fire continues to burn actively with greatest rates of spread experienced on exposed ridgetops and drainages. Sunny skies prevailed across the incident today. Tonight, weak northerly winds are expected with low humidity. With this, critical fire weather conditions are possible Saturday night with a FIRE WEATHER WATCH expected to begin at 6PM. 
The Los Angeles County and CAL FIRE Damage Assessment Teams (DINS) will continue to assess and validate structures impacted by the Palisades Fire. It is expected that more than 5,000 structures have been destroyed.
The Los Angeles Unified School District has canceled classes for all schools Friday. Residents are encouraged to avoid nonessential travel to allow firefighters plenty of room to work.
Additionally, we have been made aware that there is an inaccurate social media post circulating on Facebook suggesting that people can come work in California as part of a clean-up crew in areas that burned in recent wildfires. There is no truth to this social media post, and there is no need to call and inquire.

Situation Summary
Fire continues to burn actively with greatest rates of spread experienced on exposed ridgetops and drainages. Sunny skies prevailed across the incident today. Tonight, weak northerly winds are expected with low humidity. With this, critical fire weather conditions are possible Saturday night with a FIRE WEATHER WATCH expected to begin at 6PM. 
The Los Angeles County and CAL FIRE Damage Assessment Teams (DINS) will continue to assess and validate structures impacted by the Palisades Fire. It is expected that more than 5,000 structures have been destroyed.
The Los Angeles Unified School District has canceled classes for all schools Friday. Residents are encouraged to avoid nonessential travel to allow firefighters plenty of room to work.
Additionally, we have been made aware that there is an inaccurate social media post circulating on Facebook suggesting that people can come work in California as part of a clean-up crew in areas that burned in recent wildfires. There is no truth to this social media post, and there is no need to call and inquire.

Situation Summary
Fire continues to burn actively with greatest rates of spread experienced on exposed ridgetops and drainages. Sunny skies prevailed across the incident today. Tonight, weak northerly winds are expected with low humidity. With this, critical fire weather conditions are possible Saturday night with a FIRE WEATHER WATCH expected to begin at 6PM. 
The Los Angeles County and CAL FIRE Damage Assessment Teams (DINS) will continue to assess and validate structures impacted by the Palisades Fire. It is expected that more than 5,000 structures have been destroyed.
The Los Angeles Unified School District has canceled classes for all schools Friday. Residents are encouraged to avoid nonessential travel to allow firefighters plenty of room to work.
Additionally, we have been made aware that there is an inaccurate social media post circulating on Facebook suggesting that people can come work in California as part of a clean-up crew in areas that burned in recent wildfires. There is no truth to this social media post, and there is no need to call and inquire.

Situation Summary
The Palisades Fire continues to exhibit wind-driven and topographic runs upslope, with short-range spotting. For today, the north to northeast winds will shift to the north but humidity will remain low. A RED FLAG WARNING is still in effect until 6:00PM. On Saturday, typical mid-January conditions are expected. Sunday and continuing through the middle of next week, weak to moderate Santa Ana winds are expected. There is a chance of strong winds Tuesday. There will continue to be a high likelihood of critical fire weather conditions through next week.
The Los Angeles County and CAL FIRE Damage Assessment Teams (DINS) will continue to assess and validate structures impacted by the Palisades Fire. It is expected that more than 5,000 structures have been destroyed.
The Los Angeles Unified School District has canceled classes for all schools Friday. Residents are encouraged to avoid nonessential travel to allow firefighters plenty of room to work.
Additionally, we have been made aware that there is an inaccurate social media post circulating on Facebook suggesting that people can come work in California as part of a clean-up crew in areas that burned in recent wildfires. There is no truth to this social media post, and there is no need to call and inquire.

Situation Summary
The Palisades Fire continues to exhibit wind-driven and topographic runs upslope, with short-range spotting. For today, the north to northeast winds will shift to the north but humidity will remain low. A RED FLAG WARNING is still in effect until 6:00PM. On Saturday, typical mid-January conditions are expected. Sunday and continuing through the middle of next week, weak to moderate Santa Ana winds are expected. There is a chance of strong winds Tuesday. There will continue to be a high likelihood of critical fire weather conditions through next week.
The Los Angeles County and CAL FIRE Damage Assessment Teams (DINS) will continue to assess and validate structures impacted by the Palisades Fire. It is expected that more than 5,000 structures have been destroyed.
The Los Angeles Unified School District has canceled classes for all schools Friday. Residents are encouraged to avoid nonessential travel to allow firefighters plenty of room to work.
Additionally, we have been made aware that there is an inaccurate social media post circulating on Facebook suggesting that people can come work in California as part of a clean-up crew in areas that burned in recent wildfires. There is no truth to this social media post, and there is no need to call and inquire.

Situation Summary
The Palisades Fire continues to exhibit wind-driven and topographic runs upslope, with short-range spotting. For today, the north to northeast winds will shift to the north but humidity will remain low. A RED FLAG WARNING is still in effect until 6:00PM. On Saturday, typical mid-January conditions are expected. Sunday and continuing through the middle of next week, weak to moderate Santa Ana winds are expected. There is a chance of strong winds Tuesday. There will continue to be a high likelihood of critical fire weather conditions through next week.
The Los Angeles County and CAL FIRE Damage Assessment Teams (DINS) will continue to assess and validate structures impacted by the Palisades Fire. It is expected that more than 5,000 structures have been destroyed.
The Los Angeles Unified School District has canceled classes for all schools Friday. Residents are encouraged to avoid nonessential travel to allow firefighters plenty of room to work.
Additionally, we have been made aware that there is an inaccurate social media post circulating on Facebook suggesting that people can come work in California as part of a clean-up crew in areas that burned in recent wildfires. There is no truth to this social media post, and there is no need to call and inquire.

The Palisades Fire continues to exhibit wind-driven and topographic runs upslope, with short-range spotting. For today, the north to northeast winds will shift to the north but humidity will remain low. A RED FLAG WARNING is still in effect until 6:00PM. On Saturday, typical mid-January conditions are expected. Sunday and continuing through the middle of next week, weak to moderate Santa Ana winds are expected. There is a chance of strong winds Tuesday. There will continue to be a high likelihood of critical fire weather conditions through next week.
The Los Angeles County and CAL FIRE Damage Assessment Teams (DINS) will continue to assess and validate structures impacted by the Palisades Fire. More than 5,000 structures have been destroyed.
The Los Angeles Unified School District has canceled classes for all schools Friday. Residents are encouraged to avoid nonessential travel to allow firefighters plenty of room to work.

The National Weather Service has extended the Red Flag Warning through 6:00pm Friday. Across the fire area in the ridges and upper slopes, northeast winds are expected to diminish Thursday afternoon. However, winds are expected to pick up again in the evening and stay strong through Friday morning. On Sunday and continuing through the middle of next week, a persistent offshore flow will return to the area. An extended weak to moderate period of Santa Ana winds is expected. There is a 30% chance of strong Santa Ana winds occurring Monday night and into Tuesday.
Los Angeles County and the CAL FIRE Damage Assessment Team continue to assess and validate structures impacted by the Palisades Fire. There is a likelihood that more than 1,000 structures have been destroyed.
Los Angeles Unified School District has canceled classes for all schools Thursday. Residents are encouraged to avoid non-essential travel to allow firefighters plenty of room to work.

Situation Summary
The National Weather Service has extended the Red Flag Warning through 6:00pm Friday. Across the fire area in the ridges and upper slopes, northeast winds are expected to diminish Thursday afternoon. However, winds are expected to pick up again in the evening and stay strong through Friday morning. On Sunday and continuing through the middle of next week, a persistent offshore flow will return to the area. An extended weak to moderate period of Santa Ana winds is expected. There is a 30% chance of strong Santa Ana winds occurring Monday night and into Tuesday.
Los Angeles County and the CAL FIRE Damage Assessment Team continue to assess and validate structures impacted by the Palisades Fire. There is a likelihood that more than 1,000 structures have been destroyed.
Los Angeles Unified School District has canceled classes for all schools Thursday. Residents are encouraged to avoid non-essential travel to allow firefighters plenty of room to work.
